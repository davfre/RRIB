{"name":"RRIB","tagline":"Reproducible Research In Bioinformatics","body":"## Reproducible Research in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics\r\n\r\nThe scientific process in life science research, from data collection and\r\nprocessing to analyses, visualization and conclusions, increasingly depend\r\non algorithms and computation. Collaborative projects where researchers share\r\nwritten analyses, data files and computing scripts electronically are now\r\nthe norm rather than the exception. Frequently, the analysis is so complex that\r\nit is near impossible to fully describe in a written document.\r\n\r\nTo convey findings with clarity, making it possible for a researcher to\r\ncompletely follow someone elseâ€™s work, is the crux of scientific collaboration.\r\nThus, reproducible research, and reproducible computation in particular, has\r\nreceived increasing attention in the scientific community in recent years. \r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn this practical and hands-on course, we will learn effective methods for\r\ncollaborative and reproducible research, while learning bioinformatics and\r\nstatistics methods relevant for our own research. Following a workshop that\r\nintroduces and teaches methods, each student will reproduce a chosen paper\r\nusing R + open source tools, and make the reproduction available online.\r\n\r\n## Learning outcomes\r\n\r\n-   You will learn good practise for how to make your own research reproducible.\r\n\r\n-   Reproduce the figures, tables, and statistical methods of a\r\n    [selected published paper](http://davfre.github.io/RRIB/) using R markdown\r\n    (and open-source tools).\r\n\r\n-   Make the reproduction publically available (git repo + blog post, possibly\r\na paper in http://rescience.github.io/read/ if suitable)\r\n\r\n-   Understand and apply methods relevant for your own research\r\n\r\n-   Collaborate and create science.\r\n\r\n## Modules\r\n\r\n### Pre-workhop\r\n\r\nAs part of the course, you will actually reproduce the main findings, tables\r\nand figures of a paper. You will spend substantial time and effort on reproducing\r\na paper, so selection is very important. Please make suggestions [here](papers.md).\r\n\r\nYou should select two papers that you would like to reproduce (one is backup).\r\nCriteria:\r\n\r\n- highly relevant to your own research\r\n\r\n- focus mostly on analyses of empirical data\r\n\r\n- raw data must be available.\r\n\r\n- reproduction should appear feasible in a weeks effort (spread over a couple\r\nof months) at most. If the paper is massive, you may reproduce a suitabily sized\r\nand interesting section of it.\r\n\r\n### Workshop (2 days)\r\n\r\n- Collaborative science with Git [basics, branching, pull requests]\r\n\r\n- Data management, processing, cleaning\r\n\r\n- R and RMarkdown\r\n\r\n- Dealing with dependencies [packaging, containers]\r\n\r\n- Presentation of the paper you have chosen: underlying data, which portions of\r\nthe paper you will reproduce\r\n\r\n### Capstone project (~40 hrs)\r\n\r\nThe capstone project represents the majority of the course work.\r\nThis will be done by way of online collaborative reproduction\r\nwith 1-2 students per project via github.com. Bi-weekly peer-assessment\r\n[you provide feedback to other projects] and a final delivery deadline.\r\n\r\n- Reproductions will be in R markdown, and should be generously commented.\r\n\r\n- Data manipulations must be done programmatically in R (or other open source software, if\r\nrequired). No alteration of original data files allowed.\r\n\r\n- A reproduction will follow the sequence data download, data processing, and\r\nfinally reproduction of results/figures/tables.\r\n\r\n## Outcome\r\n\r\nThe final report (blog post) will include:\r\n\r\n-   A fully reproduced paper that can be generated from\r\n    the raw datasets, available online [here](http://davfre.github.io/RRIB/).\r\n\r\n-   An online report of your reproduction, with code.\r\n\r\n-   Research ideas.\r\n\r\n-   Outstanding issues.\r\n\r\n-   Parts of the paper we decided to not reproduce and why.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Online collaboration and participation\r\n\r\nAnyone can read and contribute to a reproduction on github, see\r\n[here](contributing.md) for detailed instructions. \r\n\r\n## Communication\r\n\r\nPlease use the RRIB github repository Issues and Wiki for as much communication\r\nas possible. There will be no email list. Any enquiries should be made as an\r\nIssue or wiki entry here: https://github.com/davfre/RRIB \r\n\r\n## ECTS points\r\n\r\nNorbis Students can gain 5 (10?) ECTS for attending the workshop, completing the\r\ncapstone project, and actively providing peer assessment.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
